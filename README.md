# FREEcycle

A team collaboration in software development wireframe and prototype,
with applied practice in an Agile-Scrum hybrid methodology. 

# Introduction

Our team developed and pitched a software solution to empower the SU community to reuse items (furniture, appliances)
 and reduce waste. This software system facilitates transactions between current university staff, faculty and students.

FREEcycle provides the university staff, faculty and students with a safe and easy way to reuse and upcycle items within the community.
 This project not only benefits the university by being a low maintenance, self-policing system for reducing waste, but also benefits
 the staff and students by providing free access to items that they may need.
